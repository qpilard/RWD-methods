# Welcome {.unnumbered}
This book provides a hands-on guide to analyzing Real World Data (RWD) using a motivating example and R code.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cloudword.jpeg")
```

This book begins with **Chapter** \@ref(introduction), which offers an overview of RWD, highlighting key concepts and the challenges commonly encountered in this field.

Following this, a motivating example is introduced in **Chapter** \@ref(motivating-example), which will be used throughout the book to illustrate each subsequent chapter with practical R code for reproducibility (used packages are listed in Appendix \@ref(r-packages)).

The next chapters focus on approaches to limit these inherent biases:

-   **Chapter** \@ref(target-trial-emulation) presents the Hern√°n et al. framework, a key approach to Target Trial Emulation (TTE) that strengthens the reliability of Real World Evidence (RWE) to address inherent biases.

-   **Chapter** \@ref(iptw-application) focuses on Propensity Score (PS) techniques aiming to reduce confounding bias at baseline.

-   **Chapter** \@ref(clone-censor-weight) examines the Clone-Censor-Weight (CCW) approach, a method to limit both confounding and immortal bias in the context of time-varying treatments.
