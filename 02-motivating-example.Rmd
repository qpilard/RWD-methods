Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) is a chronic mood disorder characterized by a consistently low mood that lasts for at least two years, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Antidepressants serve as the primary treatment for PDD, aiding in symptom management and reducing the risk of relapse. Among these medications, Sertralex and Duloxyn are frequently prescribed, each operating through distinct mechanisms.

In this context, clinicians aim to compare the effectiveness of Sertralex and Duloxyn in prolonging the time to relapse over a maximum follow-up period of one year, which is considered the maximum duration of treatment for patients newly diagnosed with PDD. Given the RWD setting, treatment switches are likely to occur; therefore, switches were evaluated at the six-week mark to determine whether individuals transitioned from Sertralex to Duloxyn or vice versa.

To address this, two types of analyses were proposed: one that evaluates the overall treatment effect without considering any changes in therapy during the follow-up period, and another that assesses the treatment effect while accounting for switches identified at the six-week follow-up by censoring at the point of change.

Here is the list of variables included in the dataset:

-   **ID**: Patient identifier

-   **AGE**: Age at diagnosis (years)

-   **GENDER**: Sex of the patient [0 = Male; 1 = Female]

-   **BECK**: Beck Depression Inventory score at diagnosis

-   **SOCIO_ECO**: Socioeconomic status (scale 1-5)

-   **EVENT**: Relapse indicator [0 = No relapse; 1 = Relapse]

-   **TIME_TO_EVENT**: Time from diagnosis to event of interest or censoring

-   **TREAT**: Therapy initiated at diagnosis [0 = Sertralex; 1 = Duloxyn].

-   **SWITCH**: Indicates if the patient switched to the alternate therapy [0 = No switch; 1 = Switched].

Further information on the simulation process to generate these data are described in Appendix \@ref(r-code).
