Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) is a chronic mood disorder characterized by a consistently low mood that lasts for at least two years, significantly impacting patients' quality of life.

Antidepressants serve as the primary treatment for PDD, helping in managing symptoms and reducing the risk of relapse. Among these medications, Sertralex and Duloxyn are frequently prescribed, each operating through distinct mechanisms.

This hypothetical study aims to compare the effectiveness of Sertralex and Duloxyn in prolonging the time to relapse over a maximum follow-up period of one year, representing the typical treatment duration for patients newly diagnosed with PDD.

To capture different clinical settings, we consider two scenarios:

-   **Scenario 1:** In this simplified setup, treatment with Sertralex or Duloxyn begins immediately following the PDD diagnosis.

-   **Scenario 2:** In a more realistic setup, a 30-day "grace period" is introducedâ€”a period following PDD diagnosis during which treatment initiation can occur. This grace period reflects common clinical practice, as clinicians may not always recommend immediate drug therapy after diagnosis.

Here is the list of variables included in the dataset:

-   **ID**: Patient identifier

-   **AGE**: Age at diagnosis (years)

-   **GENDER**: Gender of the patient [0=Male; 1=Female]

-   **BECK**: Beck Depression Inventory score at diagnosis [0 (best prognosis) - 63 (worst prognosis)]

-   **SOCIO_ECO**: Socioeconomic status (SES status) [1=Very low; 2=Low; 3=Moderate; 4=High; 5=Very high]

-   **EVENT**: Relapse indicator [0=No relapse; 1=Relapse]

-   **TIME_TO_EVENT**: Time from diagnosis to event of interest or censoring (in days)

-   **TREAT**: Therapy initiated at diagnosis [0=Sertralex; 1=Duloxyn].

-   **TIME_TO_TREAT**: Time from diagnosis to treatment (in days)

Further information on the simulation process to generate these data are described in Appendix \@ref(r-code).
