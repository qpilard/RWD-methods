# Clone-Censor-Weight method {#clone-censor-weight}

## Background

In addition to the confounding often present in RWD, another challenge is immortal time bias, which typically arises when there is a delay between the start of follow-up (time zero) and the initiation of treatment. To address both confounding and immortal time bias, the Clone-Censor-Weight (CCW) approach was introduced [@hernan_specifying_2016; @maringe_reflection_2020]. Zhao et al. further categorized three common scenarios where CCW is applicable: grace periods, static time-related strategies, and dynamic strategies [@zhao_versatility_2021].

The scenario 2 discussed in Chapter \@ref(motivating-example) will be applied to illustrate the application of CCW .

## Implement CCW
