# Target Trial Emulation using observational data {#target-trial-emulation}

## Background

In 2016, Hern√°n and Rubins presented a TTE framework to emulate a clinical trial using observational data when no clinical trial exists [@hernan_using_2016].The latter is a 2-step process: (1) **Specifying the target trial** (i.e., which is the hypothetical trial that could have been performed to answer the research question). This includes these elements eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, assignment procedures, follow-up period, outcome, causal contrast of interest and analysis plan, and (2) **Emulating each element** from the target trial.

Let us illustrate the TTE framework using our motivating example.

## Specify the target trial

As suggested, we specified the target trial as below:

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Protocol component               | Target trial emulation                                                                                                                                                                       |
+==================================+==============================================================================================================================================================================================+
| **Eligibility criteria**         | Individuals aged 18 or older, newly diagnosed with PDD.                                                                                                                                      |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Treatment strategies**         | Individuals who initiated Sertralex or Duloxyn.                                                                                                                                              |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Assignment procedures**        | Individuals randomly assigned to either strategy at baseline and are not aware of the assigned strategy                                                                                      |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Follow-up period**             | Starts at randomization and ends at the first occurrence of a relapse event, death, or after one year of follow-up, whichever occurs first.                                                  |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Outcome**                      | Relapse (defined as a recurrence of depressive disorder) diagnosed by a clinician, identified through clinical assessment or documented diagnosis of depression during the follow-up period. |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Causal contrasts of interest** | Intention-to-treat (ITT): Effect of being assigned to treatment strategies at randomization, regardless of whether individuals adhere to them during follow-up.                              |
|                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                                  | Per Protocol (PP): Individuals who discontinued treatment during follow-up were right censored at the first occurence.                                                                       |
|                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                                  | (see Appendix \@ref(ich) for causal contrasts of interest defined as formulated in the ICH E9 (R1) addendum)                                                                                 |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Analysis plan**                | In both analyses (ITT and PP), Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to compare the time to relapse from randomization between Sertralex and Duloxyn      |
|                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                                  | To estimate the validity of PP, adjustment for post randomization confunding is anticipated using Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighted (IPCW) methods [@robins_correcting_2000]          |

## Emulate the target trial

Next, we examined each component and detailed how they can be derived using RWD.

**Eligibility criteria**: We included individuals aged 18 or older who were firstly diagnosed with PDD.

**Treatment strategies**: We defined two treatment strategies: either Sertralex or Duloxyn as the first prescription following a PDD diagnosis. In scenario 1 (see Chapter \@ref(motivating-example)), this is considered as immediate, while in scenario 2, we allowed a period of up to 30 days to record the first initiation.

**Assignment procedures**: We assumed these two groups were exchangeable at the date of PDD diagnosis (or up to 30 days following PDD diagnosis for scenario 2), conditionally on baseline covariates: Age, gender, Beck score and socioeconomic status.

**Follow-up periods**: We defined time zero as the date of PDD diagnosis. From this point, we followed-up individuals until the earliest of the following events: first clinical relapse, loss of follow-up (corresponds to the last activity record in the database), 365 days after time zero.

**Outcomes**: We assumed the outcome as the first relapse occurring after time zero.

**Causal contrast of interest**: We considered observational analogues of the ITT and PP effect. However, the ITT effect in the emulated trial is closer to a PP effect, as we lack information on treatment discontinuation, and thus assumed full adherence throughout the study.

**Analysis plan**: In scenario 1, we used Inverse Probability Treatment Weights (IPTW) to emulate the randomization process and applied these weights in the outcome analysis, including weighted Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models (see Chapter \@ref(iptw-application) for further details). In scenario 2, we implemented the Clone-Censor-Weight method (CCW) to address both confounding and immortal time bias due to the permitted delay between PDD diagnosis and treatment initiation (see Chapter \@ref(clone-censor-weight) for further details).
