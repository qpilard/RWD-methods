	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: There is a need to develop hybrid trial methodology combining the best parts of traditional randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) and observational study designs to produce real-world evidence ({RWE}) that provides adequate scientific evidence for regulatory decision-making.
{METHODS}: This review explores how hybrid study designs that include features of {RCTs} and studies with real-world data ({RWD}) can combine the advantages of both to generate {RWE} that is fit for regulatory purposes.
{RESULTS}: Some hybrid designs include randomization and use pragmatic outcomes; other designs use single-arm trial data supplemented with external comparators derived from {RWD} or leverage novel data collection approaches to capture long-term outcomes in a real-world setting. Some of these approaches have already been successfully used in regulatory decisions, raising the possibility that studies using {RWD} could increasingly be used to augment or replace traditional {RCTs} for the demonstration of drug effectiveness in certain contexts. These changes come against a background of long reliance on {RCTs} for regulatory decision-making, which are labor-intensive, costly, and produce data that can have limited applicability in real-world clinical practice.
{CONCLUSIONS}: While {RWE} from observational studies is well accepted for satisfying postapproval safety monitoring requirements, it has not commonly been used to demonstrate drug effectiveness for regulatory purposes. However, this position is changing as regulatory opinions, guidance frameworks, and {RWD} methodologies are evolving, with growing recognition of the value of using {RWE} that is acceptable for regulatory decision-making.},

When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment-the target experiment or target trial-that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.},

	abstract = {The propensity score is defined as a subject's probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting ({IPTW}) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of {IPTW} has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of 'best practice' when using {IPTW} to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data.},

This review examined the use of {DAGs} in applied health research to inform recommendations for improving their transparency and utility in future research.Original health research articles published during 1999–2017 mentioning ‘directed acyclic graphs’ (or similar) or citing {DAGitty} were identified from Scopus, Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Data were extracted on the reporting of: estimands, {DAGs} and adjustment sets, alongside the characteristics of each article’s largest {DAG}.A total of 234 articles were identified that reported using {DAGs}. A fifth (n = 48, 21\%) reported their target estimand(s) and half (n = 115, 48\%) reported the adjustment set(s) implied by their {DAG}(s). Two-thirds of the articles (n = 144, 62\%) made at least one {DAG} available. {DAGs} varied in size but averaged 12 nodes [interquartile range ({IQR}): 9–16, range: 3–28] and 29 arcs ({IQR}: 19–42, range: 3–99). The median saturation (i.e. percentage of total possible arcs) was 46\% ({IQR}: 31–67, range: 12–100). 37\% (n = 53) of the {DAGs} included unobserved variables, 17\% (n = 25) included ‘super-nodes’ (i.e. nodes containing more than one variable) and 34\% (n = 49) were visually arranged so that the constituent arcs flowed in the same direction (e.g. top-to-bottom).There is substantial variation in the use and reporting of {DAGs} in applied health research. Although this partly reflects their flexibility, it also highlights some potential areas for improvement. This review hence offers several recommendations to improve the reporting and use of {DAGs} in future research.},

Conditioning on the propensity score results in unbiased estimation of the expected difference in observed responses to two treatments. The degree to which conditioning on the propensity score introduces bias into the estimation of the conditional odds ratio or conditional hazard ratio, which are frequently used as measures of treatment effect in observational studies, has not been extensively studied. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to determine the degree to which propensity score matching, stratification on the quintiles of the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score result in biased estimation of conditional odds ratios, hazard ratios, and rate ratios. We found that conditioning on the propensity score resulted in biased estimation of the true conditional odds ratio and the true conditional hazard ratio. In all scenarios examined, treatment effects were biased towards the null treatment effect. However, conditioning on the propensity score did not result in biased estimation of the true conditional rate ratio. In contrast, conventional regression methods allowed unbiased estimation of the true conditional treatment effect when all variables associated with the outcome were included in the regression model. The observed bias in propensity score methods is due to the fact that regression models allow one to estimate conditional treatment effects, whereas propensity score methods allow one to estimate marginal treatment effects. In several settings with non-linear treatment effects, marginal and conditional treatment effects do not coincide.},

Twenty-nine percent, 36\%, and 34\% of patients were judged necessary, appropriate, or uncertain, respectively, for angiography while 60\% of those judged necessary received the procedure during the hospitalization. The 3-year survival benefit was largest for patients rated necessary [mean survival difference (95\% {CI}): 17.6\% (15.1, 20.1)] and smallest for those rated uncertain [8.8\% (6.8, 10.7)].

Because of the magnitude of the benefit and of the number of patients involved, steps should be taken to replicate these findings.},

The emulation of the target trial may fail when researchers deviate from simple principles that guide the design and analysis of randomized experiments. We review a framework to describe and prevent biases, including immortal time bias, that result from a failure to align start of follow-up, specification of eligibility, and treatment assignment. We review some analytic approaches to avoid these problems in comparative effectiveness or safety research.},

We would like to expand on the versatility of the clone-censor-weight approach by bringing other applications to the readers’ attention (see Table 1 for a non-exhaustive overview). In all cases, cloning overcomes assignment ambiguity at follow-up time zero that can occur both in dynamic treatment strategies (that change according to evolving patient characteristics) or static treatment strategies (that do not). We propose three main categories (and combinations thereof) relating to: grace periods, static time-related strategies and dynamic strategies.},
