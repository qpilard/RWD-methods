## Definition

As defined by the FDA, **RWD** refers to data relating to patient health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from a variety of sources. **Real World Evidence (RWE)** is the clinical evidence generated from RWD to inform decision-makers about the use of medical products [@commissioner_real-world_2024].

## Use of RWD in drug development

In drug development, RWD has traditionally been used in phase IV trials for post-market safety assessments. However, its potential applications extend throughout the entire drug lifecycle [@khosla_real_2018]. This includes:

1.  **Discovery and Early Development:**

    *Purpose*: Identify diseases with a high burden on populations and unmet needs.

    *RWE Use*: Helps define the target product profile by analyzing disease burden and patient characteristics, guiding the selection of indications and prioritizing development.

2.  **Phase 1–3 Clinical Trials:**

    *Purpose:* Design clinical trials and ensure they reflect real-world populations.

    *RWE Use*: Provides insights into real-world patient populations and treatment patterns, helping to refine inclusion/exclusion criteria and improve the external validity of trials.

3.  **Regulatory Approval (Phase 3):**

    *Purpose:* Obtain marketing authorization for new drugs.

    *RWE Use*: Supports clinical trial data by providing additional evidence on real-world safety, efficacy, and patient outcomes, potentially accelerating approval processes.

4.  **Post-Approval (Phase 4) and Market Access:**

    *Purpose:* Ensure broad access and reimbursement.

    *RWE Use:* Provides evidence on the real-world effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the drug compared to standard care, supporting reimbursement decisions and market access strategies.

5.  **Post-Market Surveillance and Lifecycle Management:**

    *Purpose:* Monitor long-term safety and maintain market access.

    *RWE Use:* Continuously tracks patient outcomes, adherence, and safety data in real-world settings, supporting the long-term value demonstration and label expansion into new populations or indications.

## Addressing Challenges with RWD: External Control Arms and Emulation of Trials

While **RCTs** remain the **gold standard** for generating unbiased evidence due to their controlled and randomized nature, there are situations where a traditional control group is not available or feasible. In such cases, researchers can resort to two alternative approaches: **External Control Arm (ECA)** or the **Target Trial Emulation (TTE)** [@baumfeld_andre_trial_2020; @hernan_using_2016]. These two methods are illustrated below:

```

The ECA method involves using historical or real-world data as a comparative baseline, offering a way to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment in the absence of a control group. Alternatively, the TTE seeks to replicate the design of an RCT as closely as possible, but within the context of RWD. Both methods present viable alternatives, but they come with inherent risks of bias due to the lack of randomization.

Common biases include: selection bias, which arises from non-random selection of treatment groups; measurement bias, resulting from inaccuracies in data collection; confounding bias, where external factors influence both treatment and outcome; information bias, stemming from differences in data quality between groups; and immortal time bias, which occurs when there are differences in observation periods for the treatment groups.
