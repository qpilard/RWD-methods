## Definition

According to the main regulatory agencies, these are the definition of **RWD** and **RWE** [@baumfeld_andre_trial_2020]:

| Regulatory agency | Real-World Data | Real-World Evidence |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|
| FDA (USA) | Data relating to patient health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from a variety of sources | Clinical evidence about the usage and potential benefits or risks of a medical product derived from analysis of RWD |
| EMA (Europe) | Health care related data that is collected outside of randomized clinical trials | Evidence coming from registries, electronic health records, and insurance data |
| PMDA (Japan) | Utilization of patient registry data and medical information database | No definition was found |

As presented, definitions are fairly consistent with each other.

## Use of RWD in drug development

In drug development, RWD has traditionally been used in post-market safety surveillance. However, its potential applications extend throughout the entire drug lifecycle [@khosla_real_2018]. This includes:

1.  **Discovery and Early Development:**

    *Purpose*: Characterize disease epidemiology and unmet needs.

    *RWE Use*: Helps define the target product profile by analyzing disease burden and patient characteristics, guiding the selection of indications and prioritizing development.

2.  **Phase 1–3 Clinical Trials:**

    *Purpose:* Design clinical trials and ensure they reflect real-world populations.

    *RWE Use*: Provides insights into real-world patient populations and treatment patterns, helping to refine inclusion/exclusion criteria and improve the external validity of trials.

3.  **Regulatory Approval:**

    *Purpose:* Obtain marketing authorization for new drugs.

    *RWE Use*: Supports clinical trial data by providing additional evidence on real-world safety, efficacy, and patient outcomes, potentially accelerating approval processes.

4.  **Post-Approval (Phase 4) and Market Access:**

    *Purpose:* Ensure broad access and reimbursement.

    *RWE Use:* Provides evidence on the real-world effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the drug compared to standard care, supporting reimbursement decisions and market access strategies.

5.  **Post-Market Surveillance and Lifecycle Management:**

    *Purpose:* Monitor long-term safety and maintain market access.

    *RWE Use:* Continuously tracks patient outcomes, adherence, and safety data in real-world settings, supporting the long-term value demonstration and label expansion into new populations or indications.

## Regulators acceptance of RWD

RWD is gaining increasing interest and acceptance from regulators as a **complement to clinical trial** findings. For example, various frameworks have been established, such as the "**Real-World Evidence Framework to Support EU Regulatory Decision-Making**" by the EMA and the "**Real-World Evidence Program**" by the FDA [@ema_2024; @fda_real-world_2024]. Additionally, the FDA has issued guidance for industry titled "**Considerations for the Use of Real-World Data and Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Drug and Biological Products**" [@fda_considerations].

Moreover, FDA-funded initiative like the **DUPLICATE** program have been undertaken. This program focuses on replicating large-scale Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) using RWD to evaluate the reliability and confidence in analyses based on RWE [@franklin_emulating_2021].

## Use of External Control Arm and Target Trial Emulation

While RCTs remain the gold standard for generating unbiased evidence due to their controlled and randomized nature, there are situations where a traditional control group is not available or feasible. In such cases, researchers can resort to two alternative approaches: **External Control Arm (ECA)** or the **Target Trial Emulation (TTE)** [@baumfeld_andre_trial_2020; @hernan_using_2016]. These two methods are illustrated below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%', fig.cap="Main study designs using RWD"}

```

The ECA method involves using historical or real-world data as a comparative baseline, offering a way to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment in the absence of a control group. Alternatively, the TTE seeks to replicate the design of an RCT as closely as possible, but within the context of RWD.

## Main biases in RWD

Although ECA and TTE are viable alternatives to RCT, they come with inherent risks of bias due to the lack of randomization. This includes: selection bias, which arises from non-random selection of treatment groups; measurement bias, resulting from inaccuracies in data collection; confounding bias, where external factors influence both treatment and outcome; information bias, stemming from differences in data quality between groups; and immortal time bias, which occurs when there are differences in observation periods for the treatment groups.
