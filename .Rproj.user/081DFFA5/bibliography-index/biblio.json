            "abstract": "PURPOSE: There is a need to develop hybrid trial methodology combining the best parts of traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational study designs to produce real-world evidence (RWE) that provides adequate scientific evidence for regulatory decision-making. METHODS: This review explores how hybrid study designs that include features of RCTs and studies with real-world data (RWD) can combine the advantages of both to generate RWE that is fit for regulatory purposes. RESULTS: Some hybrid designs include randomization and use pragmatic outcomes; other designs use single-arm trial data supplemented with external comparators derived from RWD or leverage novel data collection approaches to capture long-term outcomes in a real-world setting. Some of these approaches have already been successfully used in regulatory decisions, raising the possibility that studies using RWD could increasingly be used to augment or replace traditional RCTs for the demonstration of drug effectiveness in certain contexts. These changes come against a background of long reliance on RCTs for regulatory decision-making, which are labor-intensive, costly, and produce data that can have limited applicability in real-world clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: While RWE from observational studies is well accepted for satisfying postapproval safety monitoring requirements, it has not commonly been used to demonstrate drug effectiveness for regulatory purposes. However, this position is changing as regulatory opinions, guidance frameworks, and RWD methodologies are evolving, with growing recognition of the value of using RWE that is acceptable for regulatory decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Ideally, questions about comparative effectiveness or safety would be answered using an appropriately designed and conducted randomized experiment. When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment-the target experiment or target trial-that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.",

            "abstract": "Matching and weighting methods for observational studies involve the choice of an estimand, the causal effect with reference to a specific target population. Commonly used estimands include the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT), the average treatment effect in the untreated (ATU), the average treatment effect in the population (ATE), and the average treatment effect in the overlap (i.e., equipoise population; ATO). Each estimand has its own assumptions, interpretation, and statistical methods that can be used to estimate it. This article provides guidance on selecting and interpreting an estimand to help medical researchers correctly implement statistical methods used to estimate causal effects in observational studies and to help audiences correctly interpret the results and limitations of these studies. The interpretations of the estimands resulting from regression and instrumental variable analyses are also discussed. Choosing an estimand carefully is essential for making valid inferences from the analysis of observational data and ensuring results are replicable and useful for practitioners.",

            "abstract": "The propensity score is defined as a subject’s probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of ’best practice’ when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data.",

This review examined the use of DAGs in applied health research to inform recommendations for improving their transparency and utility in future research.Original health research articles published during 1999–2017 mentioning “directed acyclic graphs” (or similar) or citing DAGitty were identified from Scopus, Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Data were extracted on the reporting of: estimands, DAGs and adjustment sets, alongside the characteristics of each article’s largest DAG.A total of 234 articles were identified that reported using DAGs. A fifth (n = 48, 21%) reported their target estimand(s) and half (n = 115, 48%) reported the adjustment set(s) implied by their DAG(s). Two-thirds of the articles (n = 144, 62%) made at least one DAG available. DAGs varied in size but averaged 12 nodes [interquartile range (IQR): 9–16, range: 3–28] and 29 arcs (IQR: 19–42, range: 3–99). The median saturation (i.e. percentage of total possible arcs) was 46% (IQR: 31–67, range: 12–100). 37% (n = 53) of the DAGs included unobserved variables, 17% (n = 25) included “super-nodes” (i.e. nodes containing more than one variable) and 34% (n = 49) were visually arranged so that the constituent arcs flowed in the same direction (e.g. top-to-bottom).There is substantial variation in the use and reporting of DAGs in applied health research. Although this partly reflects their flexibility, it also highlights some potential areas for improvement. This review hence offers several recommendations to improve the reporting and use of DAGs in future research.",

            "abstract": "Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to estimate causal treatment effects in the medical literature. Conditioning on the propensity score results in unbiased estimation of the expected difference in observed responses to two treatments. The degree to which conditioning on the propensity score introduces bias into the estimation of the conditional odds ratio or conditional hazard ratio, which are frequently used as measures of treatment effect in observational studies, has not been extensively studied. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to determine the degree to which propensity score matching, stratification on the quintiles of the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score result in biased estimation of conditional odds ratios, hazard ratios, and rate ratios. We found that conditioning on the propensity score resulted in biased estimation of the true conditional odds ratio and the true conditional hazard ratio. In all scenarios examined, treatment effects were biased towards the null treatment effect. However, conditioning on the propensity score did not result in biased estimation of the true conditional rate ratio. In contrast, conventional regression methods allowed unbiased estimation of the true conditional treatment effect when all variables associated with the outcome were included in the regression model. The observed bias in propensity score methods is due to the fact that regression models allow one to estimate conditional treatment effects, whereas propensity score methods allow one to estimate marginal treatment effects. In several settings with non-linear treatment effects, marginal and conditional treatment effects do not coincide.",

The Cox model extends naturally to include covariates, but there is no generally accepted method to graphically depict adjusted survival curves. The authors describe a method and provide a simple worked example using inverse probability weights (IPW) to create adjusted survival curves. When the weights are non-parametrically estimated, this method is equivalent to direct standardization of the survival curves to the combined study population.",

Using propensity scores, we created a matched retrospective sample of 19,568 Medicare patients hospitalized with AMI during 1994-1995 in the United States. Twenty-nine percent, 36%, and 34% of patients were judged necessary, appropriate, or uncertain, respectively, for angiography while 60% of those judged necessary received the procedure during the hospitalization. The 3-year survival benefit was largest for patients rated necessary [mean survival difference (95% CI): 17.6% (15.1, 20.1)] and smallest for those rated uncertain [8.8% (6.8, 10.7)]. Angiography recommendations appear to select patients who are likely to benefit from the procedure and the consequent interventions. Because of the magnitude of the benefit and of the number of patients involved, steps should be taken to replicate these findings.",

The emulation of the target trial may fail when researchers deviate from simple principles that guide the design and analysis of randomized experiments. We review a framework to describe and prevent biases, including immortal time bias, that result from a failure to align start of follow-up, specification of eligibility, and treatment assignment. We review some analytic approaches to avoid these problems in comparative effectiveness or safety research.",

We would like to expand on the versatility of the clone-censor-weight approach by bringing other applications to the readers’ attention (see Table 1 for a non-exhaustive overview). In all cases, cloning overcomes assignment ambiguity at follow-up time zero that can occur both in dynamic treatment strategies (that change according to evolving patient characteristics) or static treatment strategies (that do not). We propose three main categories (and combinations thereof) relating to: grace periods, static time-related strategies and dynamic strategies.",

Although patients randomized to the bactrim arm experienced a significant delay in time to PCP, the survival experience in the two arms was not significantly different (p = .32). In this paper, we present evidence that bactrim therapy improves survival but that the standard intent-to-treat comparison failed to detect this survival advantage because a large fraction of the subjects either crossed over to the other therapy or stopped therapy altogether. We obtain our evidence of a beneficial bactrim effect on survival by artificially regarding the subjects as dependently censored at the first time the subject either stops or switches therapy; we then analyze the data with the inverse probability of censoring weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox partial likelihood estimators of Robins (1993, Proceedings of the Biopharmaceutical Section, American Statistical Association, pp. 24-33) that adjust for dependent censoring by utilizing data collected on time-dependent prognostic factors.",

            "abstract": "Introduction Depuis 2020, l’addendum ICH E9 (R1) « estimands and sensitivity analysis » introduit la notion de l’estimand au niveau réglementaire pour les essais thérapeutiques. Afin de se conformer à ce qui est désormais attendu par les autorités réglementaires, nous décrivons ici l’approche de l’estimand dans la rédaction d’essais en oncologie. Méthodes L’ICH E9 (R1) présente un cadre structuré renforçant la formulation des objectifs des essais cliniques, tant dans sa conception que dans son analyse. La construction de l’\"estimand\" permet d’aborder les différentes gestions des événements intercurrents (ICE) survenant après le début du traitement et interférant avec l’observation des critères de jugement ou affectant leur interprétation. Résultats L’estimand est une étape conceptuelle entre l’objectif et le design de l’étude, traduisant chaque objectif via les cinq attributs des estimands : traitements, population, critère de jugement, mesure statistique du critère et gestion des évènements intercurrents. Alors que l’approche classique définit des populations d’analyse, l’estimand définit la population d’analyse pertinente pour l’objectif, faisant apparaitre pour cet objectif des règles qui lui sont propres pour une meilleure précision de réponse. Cinq « estimands » standards ont été construits, apportant des approches différentes : l’estimand « treatment policy », similaire à une ITT classique, où l’ICE conjoint au traitement peut être considéré comme cliniquement intéressant. L’ICE n’est alors pas pris en considération sur la mesure, et seules les données manquantes du critère sont imputées et remplacées selon une approche conservatrice. A l’inverse, l’estimand « composite strategy » n’imputera pas ces données manquantes car l’ICE sera pris en compte dans le critère de jugement, formant ainsi un critère composite informatif pour l’effet d’intérêt. L’estimand « hypothetical strategy » envisage un scénario dans lequel l’ICE ne se produirait pas et n’impacterait pas la mesure du critère, car considéré comme indépendant du traitement. Pour l’estimand « While on Treatment Strategy », la mesure du critère est celle lors de l’ICE, les résultats post ICE ne sont pas considérés comme pertinents. Afin l’estimand « Principal Stratum Strategy » ne retient dans l’analyse qu’une partie de la population en fonction de la présence ou non d’ICE. Dans le cas où l’exclusion de l’analyse des patients est due aux ICE, l’analyse s’apparentera ainsi à une per protocole classique, survenus après la randomisation rendant les résultats discutables. Afin d’implémenter ce nouveau concept au sein des protocoles, de nouvelles guidelines ont été éditées en 2022, l’ICH M11 Template. Une définition claire des résultats est toujours nécessaire, mais l’accent mis sur les résultats n’est plus adapté et s’étend désormais aux objectifs et aux estimands. Conclusion Bien que l’estimand n’apporte aucune modification réelle en terme statistique, la compliance à son principe induit de nombreux changements dans la rédaction des documents de l’étude (protocole, PAS, RAS, article). On retiendra et décrira donc systématiquement les deux estimands principaux « treatment policy » i.e. ITT et « Principal Stratum Strategy » i.e. PP. La précocité de cette réflexion permet une adéquation entre le design de l’essai et les questions d’intérêt clinique ainsi qu’une meilleure anticipation, transparence et standardisation dans un contexte d’études dont les analyses seront réalisées à plusieurs années de leur conception.",

            "abstract": "Purpose There is a need to develop hybrid trial methodology combining the best parts of traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTsRCTs) and observational study designs to produce real‐world evidence (RWERWE) that provides adequate scientific evidence for regulatory decision‐making.Methods This review explores how hybrid study designs that include features of RCTsRCTs and studies with real‐world data (RWDRWD) can combine the advantages of both to generate RWERWE that is fit for regulatory purposes.Results Some hybrid designs include randomization and use pragmatic outcomes; other designs use single‐arm trial data supplemented with external comparators derived from RWDRWD or leverage novel data collection approaches to capture long‐term outcomes in a real‐world setting. Some of these approaches have already been successfully used in regulatory decisions, raising the possibility that studies using RWDRWD could increasingly be used to augment or replace traditional RCTsRCTs for the demonstration of drug effectiveness in certain contexts. These changes come against a background of long reliance on RCTsRCTs for regulatory decision‐making, which are labor‐intensive, costly, and produce data that can have limited applicability in real‐world clinical practice.Conclusions While RWERWE from observational studies is well accepted for satisfying postapproval safety monitoring requirements, it has not commonly been used to demonstrate drug effectiveness for regulatory purposes. However, this position is changing as regulatory opinions, guidance frameworks, and RWDRWD methodologies are evolving, with growing recognition of the value of using RWERWE that is acceptable for regulatory decision‐making.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Regulators are evaluating the use of noninterventional real-world evidence (RWE) studies to assess the effectiveness of medical products. The RCT DUPLICATE initiative (Randomized, Controlled Trials Duplicated Using Prospective Longitudinal Insurance Claims: Applying Techniques of Epidemiology) uses a structured process to design RWE studies emulating randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and compare results. We report findings of the first 10 trial emulations, evaluating cardiovascular outcomes of antidiabetic or antiplatelet medications. METHODS: We selected 3 active-controlled and 7 placebo-controlled RCTs for replication. Using patient-level claims data from US commercial and Medicare payers, we implemented inclusion and exclusion criteria, selected primary end points, and comparator populations to emulate those of each corresponding RCT. Within the trial-mimicking populations, we conducted propensity score matching to control for >120 preexposure confounders. All study measures were prospectively defined and protocols registered before hazard ratios and 95% CIs were computed. Success criteria for the primary analysis were prespecified for each replication. RESULTS: Despite attempts to emulate RCT design as closely as possible, differences between the RCT and corresponding RWE study populations remained. The regulatory conclusions were equivalent in 6 of 10. The RWE emulations achieved a hazard ratio estimate that was within the 95% CI from the corresponding RCT in 8 of 10 studies. In 9 of 10, either the regulatory or estimate agreement success criteria were fulfilled. The largest differences in effect estimates were found for RCTs where second-generation sulfonylureas were used as a proxy for placebo regarding cardiovascular effects. Nine of 10 replications had a standardized difference between effect estimates of <2, which suggests differences within expected random variation. CONCLUSIONS: Agreement between RCT and RWE findings varies depending on which agreement metric is used. Interim findings indicate that selection of active comparator therapies with similar indications and use patterns enhances the validity of RWE. Even in the context of active comparators, concordance between RCT and RWE findings is not guaranteed, partially because trials are not emulated exactly. More trial emulations are needed to understand how often and in what contexts RWE findings match RCTs.
