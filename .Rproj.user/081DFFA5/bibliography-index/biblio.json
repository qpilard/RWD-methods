            "abstract": "PURPOSE: There is a need to develop hybrid trial methodology combining the best parts of traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational study designs to produce real-world evidence (RWE) that provides adequate scientific evidence for regulatory decision-making. METHODS: This review explores how hybrid study designs that include features of RCTs and studies with real-world data (RWD) can combine the advantages of both to generate RWE that is fit for regulatory purposes. RESULTS: Some hybrid designs include randomization and use pragmatic outcomes; other designs use single-arm trial data supplemented with external comparators derived from RWD or leverage novel data collection approaches to capture long-term outcomes in a real-world setting. Some of these approaches have already been successfully used in regulatory decisions, raising the possibility that studies using RWD could increasingly be used to augment or replace traditional RCTs for the demonstration of drug effectiveness in certain contexts. These changes come against a background of long reliance on RCTs for regulatory decision-making, which are labor-intensive, costly, and produce data that can have limited applicability in real-world clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: While RWE from observational studies is well accepted for satisfying postapproval safety monitoring requirements, it has not commonly been used to demonstrate drug effectiveness for regulatory purposes. However, this position is changing as regulatory opinions, guidance frameworks, and RWD methodologies are evolving, with growing recognition of the value of using RWE that is acceptable for regulatory decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Ideally, questions about comparative effectiveness or safety would be answered using an appropriately designed and conducted randomized experiment. When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment-the target experiment or target trial-that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.",
