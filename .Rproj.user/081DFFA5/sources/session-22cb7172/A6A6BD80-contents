Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) is a chronic mood disorder marked by a persistently low mood lasting at least two years, significantly affecting patients' quality of life. Antidepressants are the mainstay of treatment for PDD, helping to manage symptoms and reduce relapse risk. Among these medications, Sertralex and Duloxyn are commonly prescribed, each with different mechanisms of action.

In this context, clinicians seek to compare the effectiveness of Sertralex and Duloxyn in delaying relapse over a maximum follow-up period of one year, which is regarded as the maximum time attributable to treatment for patients newly diagnosed with PDD. Moreover, because we are in the context of RWD, treatment switch is likely to occur in-between these drugs.

To address this, two types of analyses were proposed: one that assesses the overall treatment effect while ignoring any potential changes in therapy during the follow-up period, and another that examines the treatment effect while accounting for switches by censoring at the point of change.

Here is the list of variables included in the dataset:

-   **ID**: Patient identifier

-   **AGE**: Age at diagnosis (years)

-   **GENDER**: Sex of the patient [0 = Male; 1 = Female]

-   **BECK**: Beck Depression Inventory score at diagnosis

-   **SOCIO_ECO**: Socioeconomic status (scale 1-5)

-   **EVENT**: Relapse indicator [0 = No relapse; 1 = Relapse]

-   **FOLLOW_UP_TIME**: Time from diagnosis to relapse, censoring, or end of one-year follow-up

-   **TREAT**: Therapy initiated at diagnosis [0 = Sertralex; 1 = Duloxyn].

-   **SWITCH**: Indicates if the patient switched to the alternate therapy [0 = No switch; 1 = Switched].

-   **TIME_TO_SWITCH**: Time from diagnosis to the treatment switch, for patients who switched.
