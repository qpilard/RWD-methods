This book begins with Chapter 1, which provides an overview of Real World Data (RWD), covering key terms, uses in drug development, and challenges related to bias. Following this, a motivating example is introduced in Chapter 2, which will be used throughout the book to illustrate each subsequent chapter with practical R code for reproducibility. The next chapters focus on approaches to limit these inherent biases: Chapter 3 presents the Hernán et al. framework, a key approach to TTE that strengthens the reliability of RWE by addressing biases. Chapter 4 focuses on propensity score techniques aiming to reduce confounding bias at baseline. Chapter 5 examines the clone-censor-weight approach, a method to limit both confounding and immortal bias in the context of time-varying treatments.

However, it often extends to any observational study, such as cohort studies, case-control studies or epidemiological registries. Real World Evidence (RWE) is the clinical evidence generated from RWD to inform decision-makers about the use of medical products. 1.2 Use of RWD in drug development In drug development, RWD has traditionally been used in phase IV trials for post-market safety assessments. However, its potential applications extend throughout the entire drug lifecycle (Khosla et al. 2018). This includes: Discovery and Early Development: Purpose: Identify diseases with a high burden on populations and unmet needs. RWE Use: Helps define the target product profile by analyzing disease burden and patient characteristics, guiding the selection of indications and prioritizing development. Phase 1–3 Clinical Trials: Purpose: Design clinical trials and ensure they reflect real-world populations. RWE Use: Provides insights into real-world patient populations and treatment patterns, helping to refine inclusion/exclusion criteria and improve the external validity of trials. Regulatory Approval (Phase 3): Purpose: Obtain marketing authorization for new drugs. RWE Use: Supports clinical trial data by providing additional evidence on real-world safety, efficacy, and patient outcomes, potentially accelerating approval processes. Post-Approval (Phase 4) and Market Access: Purpose: Ensure broad access and reimbursement. RWE Use: Provides evidence on the real-world effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the drug compared to standard care, supporting reimbursement decisions and market access strategies. Post-Market Surveillance and Lifecycle Management: Purpose: Monitor long-term safety and maintain market access. RWE Use: Continuously tracks patient outcomes, adherence, and safety data in real-world settings, supporting the long-term value demonstration and label expansion into new populations or indications. 1.3 Addressing Challenges with RWD: External Control Arms and Emulation of Trials While RCTs remain the gold standard for generating unbiased evidence due to their controlled and randomized nature, there are situations where a traditional control group is not available or feasible. In such cases, researchers can resort to two alternative approaches: External Control Arm (ECA) or the Target Trial Emulation (TTE) (Baumfeld Andre et al. 2020; Hernán and Robins 2016). These two methods are illustrated below: FIGURE 1.1: Main study designs using RWD The ECA method involves using historical or real-world data as a comparative baseline, offering a way to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment in the absence of a concurrent control group. Similarly, the TTE seeks to replicate the design of an RCT as closely as possible, but within the context of RWD. Both methods present viable alternatives, but they come with inherent risks of bias due to the lack of randomization. Common biases include: selection bias, which arises from non-random selection of treatment groups; measurement bias, resulting from inaccuracies in data collection; confounding bias, where external factors influence both treatment and outcome; information bias, stemming from differences in data quality between groups; and immortal time bias, which occurs when there are differences in observation periods for the treatment groups. "],["motivating-example.html", "Chapter 2 Motivating example", " Chapter 2 Motivating example Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) is a chronic mood disorder marked by a persistently low mood lasting at least two years, significantly affecting patients’ quality of life. Antidepressants are the mainstay of treatment for PDD, helping to manage symptoms and reduce relapse risk. Among these medications, Sertralex and Duloxyn are commonly prescribed, each with different mechanisms of action. In this context, clinicians seek to compare the effectiveness of Sertralex and Duloxyn in delaying relapse over a maximum follow-up period of one year, which is regarded as the maximum time attributable to treatment for patients newly diagnosed with PDD. Moreover, because we are in the context of RWD, treatment switch is likely to occur in-between these drugs. To address this, two types of analyses were proposed: one that assesses the overall treatment effect while ignoring any potential changes in therapy during the follow-up period, and another that examines the treatment effect while accounting for switches by censoring at the point of change. Here is the list of variables included in the dataset: ID: Patient identifier AGE: Age at diagnosis (years) GENDER: Sex of the patient [0 = Male; 1 = Female] BECK: Beck Depression Inventory score at diagnosis SOCIO_ECO: Socioeconomic status (scale 1-5) EVENT: Relapse indicator [0 = No relapse; 1 = Relapse] FOLLOW_UP_TIME: Time from diagnosis to relapse, censoring, or end of one-year follow-up TREAT: Therapy initiated at diagnosis [0 = Sertralex; 1 = Duloxyn]. SWITCH: Indicates if the patient switched to the alternate therapy [0 = No switch; 1 = Switched]. TIME_TO_SWITCH: Time from diagnosis to the treatment switch, for patients who switched. "],["target-trial-emulation.html", "Chapter 3 Target Trial Emulation using observational data 3.1 Background 3.2 Specify the target trial 3.3 Emulate the target trial", " Chapter 3 Target Trial Emulation using observational data 3.1 Background In 2016, Hernán and Rubins presented a framework to emulate a clinical trial using observational data when no clinical trial exists (Hernán and Robins 2016).The latter is a 2-step process: (1) Specifying the target trial (i.e., which is the hypothetical trial that could have been performed to answer the research question). This includes these elements eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, assignment procedures, follow-up period, outcome, causal contrast of interest and analysis plan, and (2) Emulating each element from the target trial. Let us illustrate the TTE framework using our motivating example. 3.2 Specify the target trial As suggested, we specified the target trial as below: Protocol component Target trial emulation Eligibility criteria Individuals aged 18 or older, newly diagnosed with PDD. Treatment strategies Individuals who initiated Sertralex or Duloxyn. Assignment procedures Individuals randomly assigned to either strategy at baseline and are not aware of the assigned strategy (i.e., blinding) Follow-up period Starts at randomization and ends at the first occurrence of a relapse event, loss to follow-up, or after one year of follow-up, whichever occurs first. Outcome Relapse (defined as a recurrence of depressive disorder) diagnosed by a clinician, identified through clinical assessment or documented diagnosis of depression during the follow-up period. Causal contrasts of interest Intention-to-treat (ITT) Per Protocol (PP) Analysis plan In both analyses (ITT and PP), Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to compare the time to relapse from randomization between Sertralex and Duloxyn. In the PP analysis, individuals were censored at the time they switched from their initially assigned treatment to the alternative therapy. Additionally, inverse probability weighting was applied to adjust for post-baseline prognostic factors that may influence the switch. 3.3 Emulate the target trial Next, we examined each component and detailed how they can be derived using RWD. Eligibility criteria: We included individuals aged 18 or older who were diagnosed with PDD, so no additional adjustments were necessary. Treatment strategies: We defined two treatment strategies: either Sertralex or Duloxyn as the first prescription following a PDD diagnosis. Assignment procedures: We assumed these two groups were exchangeable at index date conditionally on baseline covariates: Age at index date, gender, Beck score and socioeconomic status. Follow-up periods: We defined time zero as the date of PDD diagnosis. From this point, we followed-up individuals until the earliest of the following events: first clinical relapse, loss of follow-up, 365 days after time zero, or time of treatment switch (for PP analysis only).  Outcomes: We assumed the outcome as the first relapse occurring after time zero. Causal contrast of interest: We considered observational analogues of the ITT and PP effect. Analysis plan: For the ITT analysis, we used inverse probability weights (see chapter 4 for further details) to emulate the randomization process and applied these weights in the outcome analysis, including weighted Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models. For the PP analysis, we implemented the Clone-Censor-Weight method (see chapter for further details) for further detailto address both confounding and immortal time bias introduced by accounting for treatment switching in the analysis. "],["iptw-application.html", "Chapter 4 Propensity score methods 4.1 Background 4.2 Determine confounders", " Chapter 4 Propensity score methods 4.1 Background The Propensity Score (PS) is used to replicate the randomization process, aiming to balance individual characteristics at the beginning of a study. Statistically, the PS is defined as the conditional probability of receiving the exposure of interest based on observed baseline characteristics. It is commonly estimated using multivariable logistic regression, where the exposure serves as the dependent variable and the baseline characteristics act as independent variables. Once the PS is calculated, it can be utilized in various approaches, including matching, stratification, Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW), and covariate adjustment. 4.2 Determine confounders Observed baseline characteristics incorporated in the logistic regression must affect both treatment assignment and the outcome, while not being part of the causal pathway connecting them. Other variable types, such as mediators or colliders, can also exist, but adjusting for these may introduce bias. We recommend using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to visually represent causal relationships developed in collaboration with clinical experts. DAGs can be created using the DAGitty website and the R package. In our example, we identified age at index date, gender, Beck score and socioeconomic status as potential confounders of the association between treatment exposure and relapse.
